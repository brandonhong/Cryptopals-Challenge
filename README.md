This repository contains all relevant code and files needed for the cryptopals crypto challenges (https://cryptopals.com/). 

All code is written with Python 3.6 and each challenge has its own .py file that can run independently from one another. However, all of them require the cryptohacks.py file which contains all relevant functions and libraries needed for the challenges. The files are organized by set and follow the naming convention s#C#.py. Any of these files can be run as is provided that the cryptohacks.py and letterscore.txt file are in the local directory or added to path before the script starts.

All files are open source and provided as is and may be used with or without permission.
