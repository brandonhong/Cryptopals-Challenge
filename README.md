# Cryptopals-Challenge
This repository contains all relevant code and files needed for the cryptopals crypto challenges (https://cryptopals.com/). 

All code is written with Python 3.6 and each challenge has its own .py file that can run independently from one another. However, all of them require the cryptohacks.py file which contains all relevant functions and libraries needed for the challenges. All files are open source and provided as is and may be used with or without permission.
